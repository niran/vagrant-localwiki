vagrant-localwiki
=================

`vagrant-localwiki` consists of a Vagrantfile and Chef cookbooks that launch and configure a LocalWiki server.

Usage
-----

1. [Install Vagrant.](http://vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/index.html)
2. Add a 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 box: `vagrant box add precise64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box`
3. Create and enter a directory that will contain your LocalWiki work, e.g. `~/localwiki-project/`
4. Clone this repository.
5. Clone [the LocalWiki repository](https://github.com/localwiki/localwiki) alongside this repository.
6. Create an empty localwiki_data folder (it will be mounted at `/usr/share/localwiki` to store LocalWiki's data files.)
7. `cd vagrant-localwiki`
8. `git submodule update --init`
8. `vagrant up`.
9. `vagrant ssh` to access the machine. Your LocalWiki repository is mounted at `/srv/localwiki/`. The LocalWiki virtualenv is activated at login. By default, a Django superuser named `admin` is created with the password `admin`.
10. Go to `/srv/localwiki/sapling/` and run `python manage.py init_settings` to initialize your secret key and enter your CloudMade API key.

EC2 Support
-----------

The README in the `ec2/` folder explains how to launch your configuration on an EC2 server. Here's an example command to launch a server:

    ec2-run-instances ami-a29943cb --instance-type m1.small --key aws-keypair1 --user-data-file ec2/bootstrap.sh -g web -g default
